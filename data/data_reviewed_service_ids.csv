Me and those who I asked about this upon realising this ToS change (which seemed to come after a string of bans on this, at the time, unspecified rule as announced on a private Facebook page for the site) hadn't recieved any update from the site about the terms being updated or the ability to accept these new terms. I haven't even received any emails before about any of the ToS changes that may have occured without my knowledge since I signed up to the site (on the 25th of May 2020)."

Your Personal data may be sold unless you opt out,"The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app. Some take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party. If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies."

The service explains how to prevent disclosure of personal information to third parties,"However, if you leave the ""test with a real tracking company"" option enabled, Cover Your Tracks will use a real resource from a third-party tracker for some tests in order to determine whether your ad blocker or privacy tool allows whitelisted resources, such as those under the so-called ""Acceptable Ads"" program to unblock those trackers. Your browser sends very limited information during these test, such as a request for a 'favicon', with referrers disabled where possible. We believe that in most cases, trackers will learn nothing useful from this request, though some unblocked trackers might be able to guess you were visiting Cover Your Tracks as a result of it."
The service explains how to prevent disclosure of personal information to third parties,"As a public service we try to nudge people into activating DNT headers and using tracking-blockers. If we can influence data to external services we opt to not send any. If we have to send data we minimise what is provided, f.e. if the user opts-in to use Stripe for a payment, only the invoice number and the total sum is provided to Stripe and in turn we don't query customer information Stripe gathers for fulfilment (we don't want that data in our databases). ``` Tips for privacy aware browsing In order to block so-called tracking-cookies we suggest that you use DuckDuckGo, both the app, as well as the browser extention. As alternative, or in addition, we can recommend the browser extension Privacy Badger, which also sends Do Not Track signals to each website, if requested (see below). Do Not Track (DNT) policy Our software respects Do Not Track signals sent by your browser and takes care that external services are only connected with explicit permission. This can lead to limited functionality and additional user interactions: Videos don't autoplay, payment providers are not available, registration is not possible, if an external CAPTCHA-service is required as additional security, etc. Permission is given per service, i.e. if you allow one video to play then all videos from that external provider are allowed to play in your current session. ```"
